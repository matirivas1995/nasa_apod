# NASA API REACT PROJECT

This project was created with the intention of try the NASA OPEN [API](https://api.nasa.gov/).

## Explanation

Initially it was meant to be just an APOD (Astronomy Picture of the Day) viewer, but i realize that it could be better than just that, so i decide to try the "InSight: Mars Weather Service API", just to get the conclusion that is not sending more data anymore.

Therefore i find the [REMS PROJECT](https://mars.nasa.gov/layout/embed/image/mslweather/), and find out that it consults another api, so i decided to try it out to.

The result is a Weather interfaces that shows you the weather on the last five days in mars + the astronomy picture of the day.

[DEMO](https://matirivas1995.github.io/nasa_apod/) Try it out!

Hope you enjoy it!
